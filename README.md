# XRF_Data_Vis
Codes for visualising data from XRF data

## Overview
A set of tools to convert .fsa files to .csv and plot results for analysis of DNA fragment data generated by X-Ray Footprinting experiments.

## Features
- Convert raw `.fsa` files to `.csv`
- Plot and visualise fragment data
- Preprocess for further analysis

## Getting Started

### Installation
Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/rchandlerbostock/XRF_Data_Vis.git

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Rename files
`rename_files.sh`

- To remove the added folder extension from each .fsa file, run the rename_files.sh script.
- Add it into the folder and and run as follows through terminal:
./rename_files.sh

### To convert an .fsa file
`convert_fsa_to_csv.py`

- Open terminal at folder containing .fsa files and copy the python codes in
	- In terminal run: python convert_fsa_to_csv.py

### To plot the results:
`plot_csvs.py`

- plot_csvs.py currently outputs png files but there is a commented out code for .eps instead if preferred

## Project structure
- `rename_files.sh`: Removes part of the filename string added during fragment analysis data generation
- `convert_fsa_to_csv.py`: Converts .fsa files to .csv
- `plot_csvs.py`: Plots processed data
- `GraphPlotting.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demo
